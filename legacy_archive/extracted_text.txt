A  Framework  for  Plausible,  Stochastic,  and  Adaptive  Honeypot  Behavior  
Submitted  to:  Dr.Shina  Sheen  Submitted  by:  Preetham  Bavan  E  Date:  November  07,  2025  
Objective:  Approval  to  write  two  full  research  papers  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.  Current  Limitations  of  LLM-Based  Dynamic  File  Systems  
Current  dynamic  file  systems  in  honeypots  rely  on  Large  Language  Models  (LLMs)  to  generate  
real-time
 
responses
 
to
 
attacker
 
queries.
 
Advanced
 
versions
 
maintain
 
state,
 
but
 
suffer
 
from
 
critical
 
limitations:
 
Limitation  Impact  
Latency  LLM  responses  delay  interaction  
Context  Limit  Fails  in  multi-stage  attacks  
Token  Generation  Limit  Cannot  handle  ‘ cat  *’  or  large  outputs  
Consistency  State  drift  over  time   
Result:  Attackers  detect  deception  quickly.  
2.  Proposed  Core  Idea  
Instead  of  using  LLMs  to  respond  to  attacker  queries  in  real  time,  create  a  fake  file  
system
 
and
 
periodically
 
update
 
it
 
(at
 
regular
 
or
 
random
 
intervals)
 
to
 
mimic
 
real
 
user
 
activity.
 
Use
 
LLMs
 
offline
 
to
 
generate
 
changes.
 
Key  Advantage:  
●  Zero  latency  during  attack  ●  Full  consistency  ●  Realistic  evolution  
 
 
3.  Paper  1:  Two  Core  Research  Problems  
Research  Problem  1:  Plausible  Multi-User  Behavioral  Simulation  
Sub-Problems:  
●  Persona  Definition  &  Differentiation  ●  Temporal  Consistency  (e.g.,  9–5  work,  2  AM  backups)  ●  Cross-User  Contextual  Consistency  (e.g.,  dev  commit  →  CI  build)  ●  Orchestration  Transparency  
 
Solution:  3-Step  Foundation  
 Step  Description  
1.  Define  Actor  Personas  (Who)  dev_alice ,  sys_bob ,  svc_ci  
2.  Script  the  Scenes  (What)  LLM  generates  3–5  shell  commands  
3.  Direct  the  Performance  (How)  Hidden  orchestrator  executes  as  target  user   #  Example  Execution  sudo  -u  dev_alice  touch  /var/www/html/new_feature.php  sudo  -u  dev_alice  git  commit  -m  "Add  user  auth"  
Research  Problem  2:  Stochastic  Temporal  Behavior  Modeling  with  Contextual  
Anomalies
 
Challenges:  
●  Predictability  Trap  (repeating  patterns)  ●  Behavioral  Rhythm  Modeling  (natural  variation)  ●  Plausible  Anomaly  Injection  (incidents,  vacations)  
  Problem  Example  
Same  file  edited  daily  →  fake  
No  weekends,  no  emergencies  
→  not  real  
   
Solution:  Three-Layer  Behavioral  Engine  
  Layer  Scale  How  It  Uses  the  3  Steps  
Layer  1:  Smart  Timer  
When  to  act  Uses  Step  1  (Who)  +  probability  (70%  chance  in  work  hours)  
Layer  2:  Script  Picker  
What  to  do  Uses  Step  2  (What)  +  weighted  categories  (Routine/Variant/Anomaly)  
Layer  3:  Story  Planner  
Long-term  story  
Uses  Step  2  (What)  with  LLM  over  weeks/months  
  
All  layers  feed  into  the  same  Step  3  (Orchestrator).  
   
 
4.  Variation  Strategies  (Modular  &  Combinable)  ●  All  strategies  generate  Step  2  (Scripts).  ●  All  feed  into  Step  3  (Orchestrator).  ●  Can  be  used  together  or  separately.  
  Strategy  When  Used  How  It  Fits  
1.  Template  +  Random  Daily  small  changes  Fills  variables  in  routine  scripts  
2.  Daily  LLM  Story  Every  day  LLM  reads  yesterday  →  plans  today  
3.  Monthly  Plan  Once  a  month  LLM  plans  4  weeks  →  auto  daily  
4.  Pre-Made  Cache  Once  a  month  LLM  makes  300  changes  →  use  slowly   
All  strategies  generate  scripts  →  all  go  to  the  same  controller  →  all  update  
the
 
same
 
FS.
 
 
5.  Example:  A  Week  in  the  Life  of  dev_alice   Day  Strategy  Used  What  Happens  
Mon  Monthly  Plan  Start  payment  feature  (from  June  plan)  
Tue  Template  Edit  stripe.php  +  random  commit  
Wed  Daily  LLM  “Fix  bug  from  Monday”  
Thu  Cache  Apply  12  pre-made  changes  (crunch  day)  
Fri  Anomaly  Script  “Hotfix  deployed”  →  sys_bob  reacts    
One  system.  One  controller.  Many  script  sources.  
 
6.  Technical  Consistency  Requirements   Requirement  Enforcement  
File  ownership/permissions  Match  acting  user  
Timestamps  Align  with  persona  schedule  (few  anomalies)  
.bash_history  Updated  per  command  
Process  hiding  setsid  -f ,  no  ps ,  no  jobs    
7.  Paper  2:  Adaptive  Deception  via  Attacker  Behavior  Modeling   
 
Core  Idea:  Build  on  Paper  1’s  foundation  to  make  deception  reactive .  
 
Attacker  Behavior  Signals  in  FS 
Signal  Example  
Commands  executed  
ls  -la ,  find ,  grep  
Timing  &  frequency  Night  vs.  day,  burst  vs.  slow  
Path  traversal  Order  of  directory  access  
File  operations  Read,  modify,  encrypt,  delete  
 
 
Adaptive  Triggers  (Ideas  for  Paper  2)  
●  If  attacker  reads  logs  →  Simulate  panic  cleanup.  ●  If  attacker  modifies  code  →  Trigger  "bug  discovery"  narrative.  ●  If  ransomware  pattern  →  Delay  changes,  simulate  backup  failure.  
Paper  2  will  formalize  modeling,  detection,  and  response  loops.  
 
8.  Open  Technical  Challenges  (To  Be  Addressed)   Challenge  Plan  
Orchestrator  code  for  multi-user  workflows  Modular  Python  service  
Script  storage  &  access  Hidden  dir  +  encrypted  index  
Variability  in  timing  &  selection  Configurable  RNG  +  weights  
Consistency  validation  Pre-execution  checker  
Evaluation  metrics  Attacker  dwell  time,  detection  rate,  realism  score  
 
This  is  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  open  technical  challenges.
